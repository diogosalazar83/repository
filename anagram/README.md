# HOW TO
Set up the project on your favorite IDE (I like Eclipse) and run the main on com.dsalazar.anagram.AnagramController.
You can go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to have a user friendly simple UI OR you can go directly calling on http://localhost:8080/api/anagrams/{string1}/{string2} or http://localhost:8080/api/anagrams/{string1}

Enjoy!
